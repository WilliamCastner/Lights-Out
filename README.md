# Lights Out

This program emulates an old game called Lights Out. It is a simple game consisting of a 5 x 5 grid of lights
When the game starts, lights are randomly set to on / off. Hitting a light turns the tile, and the ones adjacent to it, to the 
opposite state. 
The goal of the game is to turn all of the lights off.

## Installations
C++ is the main coding language using the OpenGL and Glut frameworks. OpenGL and Glut have to be installed for the program to run.
